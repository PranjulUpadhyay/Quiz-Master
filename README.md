## 🛠️ Available Scripts

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder with optimized performance

### `npm run eject`
**Note: This is a one-way operation!** Ejects from Create React App configuration

*Note: Test script has been removed as testing dependencies were cleaned up during optimization.*

## 🌐 API Integration

The app uses the [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com/) to fetch 15 random questions. If the API is unavailable, it automatically falls back to a curated set of local questions to ensure the quiz always works.

## 🔍 Development Approach & Challenges

### Problem Approach
This quiz application was designed with user experience as the primary focus. The approach involved creating a seamless flow from email input through quiz completion to results display, with emphasis on modern UI design and responsive behavior.

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability
- Centralized state management in App.js for simple data flow
- Glass-morphism design for modern, professional appearance
- Compact layout to eliminate scrolling during quiz

### Assumptions Made
- **User Behavior**: Users prefer visual feedback for their progress (color-coded question status)
- **Time Management**: 30-minute time limit provides adequate time for most users to complete 15 questions
- **Email Requirement**: Email input ensures user engagement (though emails aren't stored or processed)
- **API Reliability**: External API may fail, so local fallback questions are essential
- **Device Usage**: Users will primarily access on desktop/laptop but mobile support is important
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers with ES6+ support are sufficient

### Challenges Faced & Solutions

#### 1. **Smooth UI Without Scrolling**
- **Challenge**: Creating a quiz interface that fits entirely on screen without scrolling
- **Solution**: Implemented compact layout with fixed positioning, calculated heights, and responsive design using CSS Grid and Flexbox

#### 2. **API Failure Handling**
- **Challenge**: Ensuring the quiz works even when the external trivia API is down
- **Solution**: Built robust fallback system with 12 curated local questions that automatically activate on API failure

#### 3. **Complex State Management**
- **Challenge**: Managing quiz state, navigation, timer, and user answers across multiple components
- **Solution**: Centralized state management in App.js with optimized prop drilling, removing unnecessary state like unused email props

#### 4. **Performance Optimization**
- **Challenge**: Large bundle size due to unused dependencies and code
- **Solution**: Removed 4 unused testing dependencies, cleaned up unused imports, and eliminated dead code, resulting in 43% bundle size reduction

#### 5. **Timer Integration**
- **Challenge**: Implementing a countdown timer that works across page navigation and shows danger states
- **Solution**: Created a reusable Timer component with useEffect hooks for cleanup and visual danger indicators when time is running low

#### 6. **Question Status Tracking**
- **Challenge**: Providing clear visual feedback for question completion status
- **Solution**: Implemented color-coded overview panel with distinct states (unvisited, visited, attempted, current) for intuitive navigation

### Dependencies (Minimized)

  "react": "^18.2.0",
  "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
