## 🛠️ Available Scripts

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder with optimized performance

### `npm run eject`
**Note: This is a one-way operation!** Ejects from Create React App configuration

*Note: Test script has been removed as testing dependencies were cleaned up during optimization.*

## 🔄 Recent Major Changes & Improvements

### 🎨 **UI/UX Refactoring**
- **Complete visual overhaul** with modern glass-morphism design
- **Responsive layout** that works without scrolling on quiz page
- **Color-coded status indicators** throughout the application
- **Smooth animations** and gradient backgrounds
- **Improved email input** with floating labels and clear buttons
- **Professional results page** with circular score display and detailed breakdown

### 🧹 **Code Cleanup & Optimization**
- **Removed unused dependencies**:
  - `@testing-library/jest-dom`, `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/user-event`
  - `web-vitals` dependency (though reportWebVitals.js kept for compatibility)
- **Deleted test files**: `App.test.js`, `setupTests.js` (not needed for this project)
